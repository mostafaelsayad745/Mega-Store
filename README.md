# MegaStore Project

## Overview

MegaStore is a comprehensive e-commerce platform designed to facilitate online shopping experiences. The project is structured using a repository pattern to abstract the data layer, making it more maintainable and scalable. It features a robust set of entities and repositories that handle various aspects of e-commerce operations, including product management, shopping carts, order processing, and more.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into several key components, each residing in its own namespace:

- **MegaStore.Entities**: Contains the domain models and repository interfaces that define the core business objects and their behaviors.
  - **Models**: Includes classes such as `Product` and `Category` that represent the data structure.
  - **Repositories**: Defines interfaces like `IProductRepository`, `ICategoryRepository`, and others that specify the operations that can be performed on the models.

- **MegaStore.DataAccess**: Implements the repository interfaces defined in the `MegaStore.Entities` project. It includes classes like `CategoryRepository` and `ProductRepository` that contain the logic to interact with the database.

- **MegaStore.DataAccess/Implementations**: Contains the concrete implementations of the repository interfaces, providing the actual data access logic.

## Key Features

- **Product Management**: Allows for the creation, update, and deletion of products in the catalog.
- **Category Management**: Enables categorization of products for easier navigation and management.
- **Shopping Cart**: Supports adding and removing products from a user's shopping cart.
- **Order Processing**: Facilitates the creation and management of customer orders, including order details and headers.
